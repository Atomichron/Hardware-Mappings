MAPPINGS FOR COMPETITIVE FIRST PERSON SHOOTERS
(AND SINGLE PLAYER LOCAL RPGS WITH FEWER KEYS)

Not all mappings can always be satisfied, but By illustrating a general trend a mostly baseline mapping can be applied.
A few keys may be substituted or swapped in games with more fields than easily-accessible left-hand-only keyboard keys.
These mappings attempt to minimize need for right hand at all so that you can use a split keyboard and not leave mouse.

Why?
- Ideally keys should be mapped so you can always perform any function while still moving, looking around, and aiming.
- Keys that are frequently used should be closer to WASD and not require stretching (definitely map CapsLock to Ctrl).
- Important functions should be easily accessible over unimportant, but this is up to you to balance with the last pt.

How?
1. Start by mapping all keys that do not have an "! EXTRA !" slot (choose either option).
2. Map the keys above that you didn't map, either because the game doesn't have the field or has too few fields.
3. If there are still fields to map prioritize which you care to use and map these to any remaining "! EXTRA !" keys.
4. Look at the Customization Considerations at the bottom to swap or completely substitute (not use a game function).
5. Or skip all above and do your own thing because you don't care to think this granularly / apply baseline mappings!

Customization Considerations
- May want to switch (these have ! marks instead of = signs above to help you find these):
  - Melee can be on keyboard or mouse. Preference depends on how frequent and immediate you need to punch it!
- May want to substitute completely:
  - TBD...
