MAPPINGS FOR COMPETITIVE FIRST PERSON SHOOTERS AND SINGLE PLAYER LOCAL RPGS

Not all mappings can always be satisfied, but By illustrating a general trend a mostly baseline mapping can be applied.
A few keys may be substituted or swapped in games with more fields than easily-accessible left-hand-only keyboard keys.
These mappings attempt to minimize need for right hand at all so that you can use a split keyboard and not leave mouse.
